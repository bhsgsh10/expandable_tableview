# expandable_tableview
Simple example of expandable table view cells of dynamic height. 

There are many examples of expandable table view cells in iOS. However, this is the code that worked for me on Swift 5.
Most of the setup has been taken from https://sweettutos.com/2016/07/31/how-to-make-expandable-uitableviewcells-for-dynamic-text-height-with-auto-layout/, 
published in 2016. I had to tweak it to make it work the way I wanted.
This project uses storyboards and not SwiftUI.
